## üìä Examples

### Example 1: Scatter Plot with Regression Line
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
data = sns.load_dataset('tips')

# Create scatter plot
sns.lmplot(x='total_bill', y='tip', data=data, hue='sex', markers=["o", "s"])

plt.title("Scatter Plot with Regression Line")
plt.show()
```

### Example 2: Heatmap
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a sample dataset
data = sns.load_dataset('flights')
pivot_table = data.pivot("month", "year", "passengers")

# Generate a heatmap
sns.heatmap(pivot_table, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="YlGnBu")

plt.title("Flight Passengers Heatmap")
plt.show()
```
